                I am recent alumni who is among the class of 2021 University of the Pacific Tigers with a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry! Quickly after I graduated, I decided to put my degree to use in working among the front lines of drug development at a startup biotech company as a research associate. As a curious fellow, I have always had interest in the computers, so I decided to venture forward in that direction. To quickly describe myself, I would say I am a passionate worker who aims to give my best efforts, high attention to detail, optimistic, and a go-getter. One of my weaknesses include being a perfecitonist as I am seldomly satisfied with my results. My hobbies include breakdance, playing the piano, sketching, and watching movies.
